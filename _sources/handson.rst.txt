Lid-driven cavity flow
----------------------------

This case uses OpenFOAM to calculate the incompressible flow in a two-dimensional square domain, see the Figure blow

 .. image:: img/cavity2D_geometry.png


Here are some suggestions for this hands-on session.

- Write questions on `Hackmd <https://hackmd.io/@enccs/openfoam-12-2021>`_.

- Follow the instructions below to recap what we learned during th lecture.
  The material is written for the Tegner cluster, but you can start on your laptop for maximum interactivity.

- Although post-processing with Paraview is listed as optional (see last section in the hands-on), it is very highly recommended that
  you install Paraview on your machine and inspect the results of the OpenFOAM simulations.
  Of course, you can use another post-processor of your liking.

- At some point, do login to Tegner, and get comfortable with running on iteractive nodes.
  For that, follow the instructions in the `slides by Arash <https://github.com/ENCCS/OpenFOAM/blob/main/getting_started_with_Tegner.pdf>`_.


- Use the case as a sandbox to change various settings and play with the parameters. Use the "banana-trick" to learn about
  possible options: change any dictionary keyword to "banana", the case will crash showing possible valid options for the keyword.

- If you have CFD experience, ask yourself: what settings would I typically need to change?
  Then try to figure out what dictionaries and keywords correspond to that. The teachers are there to help!
  Try also to dig online a little bit yourself: one of the course outcomes is that you should be able to continue develop your skills
  on your own. 

To use OpenFOAM on Tegner, we first need to load the appropriate module.
This is followed by sourcing *$FOAM_BASHRC* to activate the OpenFOAM environment.
The *$FOAM_TUTORIALS* will then store the path to the tutorial collection shipped with OpenFOAM.
Note, you can also use the *tut* command to jump to the tutorial directory and look around.
**Important:** Always copy the tutorial to a folder where you have full write permission, never execute tutorials inside *$FOAM_TUTORIALS*. 
Also, as OpenFOAM cases are not always backward-compatible, please make sure to always copy cases from *$FOAM_TUTORIALS* of the current version you are using.

.. code:: bash

 $ module add openfoam/1912  # Using OpenFOAM v1912         
 $ echo $FOAM_BASHRC
 /pdc/vol/openfoam/v1912/OpenFOAM-v1912/etc/bashrc
 $ source $FOAM_BASHRC
 $ cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS/incompressible/icoFoam/cavity/cavity . 

- The structure of the case is shown in the following

.. code:: bash

 $ cd cavity
 $ ls
 0 constant system

 $ tree 

 ├── 0 (time directory starting with T=0, initial conditions)
 │   ├── p (pressure)
 │   └── U (flow velocity)

 └── system
    ├── blockMeshDict 
    ├── controlDict (the main dictionary for controlling the simulation)
    ├── fvSchemes
    ├── fvSolution
    ├── PDRblockMeshDict

- The default setting is to run the application *simpleFoam* in serial on a two-dimensional square mesh of size (20×20×1).
  Note that all OpenFOAM cases are three-dimensional. For a two-dimensional case the third dimension has a single computational cell,
  and special boundary conditions are employed.
  The case will run up to time *0.5* with *0.005* per step, i.e. a total of 100 time steps. The simulation results are stored every 20 time steps. 


Run the case by default
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code:: bash

 $ blockMesh # create the equivalent mesh of (20x20x1)
 $ icoFoam > log.icoFoam
 $ ls
 0  0.1  0.2  0.3  0.4  0.5  constant  system

Congratulations, you were able to run your first OpenFOAM case on a PDC cluster! 

Inspecting the log file
+++++++++++++++++++++++

To make sure everything is OK we can look at the output logs from the OpenFOAM run.
This will show us if the run actually worked as intended.
To do this, inspect *log.icoFoam* with your favorite editor or simply use commands like *tail*.

.. code:: bash

 $ tail -n 50 log.icoFoam
 Time = 0.5

 Courant Number mean: 0.222158 max: 0.852134
 smoothSolver:  Solving for Ux, Initial residual = 2.3091e-07, Final residual = 2.3091e-07, No Iterations 0
 smoothSolver:  Solving for Uy, Initial residual = 5.0684e-07, Final residual = 5.0684e-07, No Iterations 0
 DICPCG:  Solving for p, Initial residual = 8.63844e-07, Final residual = 8.63844e-07, No Iterations 0
 time step continuity errors : sum local = 8.8828e-09, global = 4.94571e-19, cumulative = 1.10417e-17
 DICPCG:  Solving for p, Initial residual = 9.59103e-07, Final residual = 9.59103e-07, No Iterations 0
 time step continuity errors : sum local = 9.66354e-09, global = 1.13175e-18, cumulative = 1.21735e-17
 ExecutionTime = 0.31 s  ClockTime = 1 s

 End

There is quite a bit of information to be extracted from the logs, such as residuals of the iterative solvers and the Courant number.
Depending on the simulation options, the logs may become more expressive, monitoring additional simulation aspects.

Creating the finer mesh
+++++++++++++++++++++++

The cavity case is too tiny to make running in parallel a reasonable alternative.
We will therefore make the mesh denser.
An overview of OpenFOAM meshing will be given during day 2 of the workshop.
For now, we just provide the instruction for refining without much explaination.
In *system/blockMeshDict*, the default mesh size is set by the triple *(20 20 1)*, 
in the following lines.

.. code:: bash

 blocks
 (
    hex (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) (20 20 1) simpleGrading (1 1 1)
 );

So, to refine we can change it to e.g. *(100 100 1)*,

.. code:: bash

 blocks
 (
    hex (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) (100 100 1) simpleGrading (1 1 1)
 ); 

And then rerun the command *blockMesh*.

.. code:: bash

 $ blockMesh

If you now run *icoFoam* you will notice that the solver is slow and that the Courant number is very high!

.. code:: bash

 Time = 0.01

 Courant Number mean: 0.514905 max: 4.28024
 smoothSolver:  Solving for Ux, Initial residual = 0.124381, Final residual = 9.84033e-06, No Iterations 374
 smoothSolver:  Solving for Uy, Initial residual = 0.546347, Final residual = 9.89857e-06, No Iterations 402
 DICPCG:  Solving for p, Initial residual = 0.937878, Final residual = 0.0449945, No Iterations 58
 time step continuity errors : sum local = 0.00115914, global = -3.719e-19, cumulative = -1.47005e-18
 DICPCG:  Solving for p, Initial residual = 0.887143, Final residual = 9.90418e-07, No Iterations 171
 time step continuity errors : sum local = 2.39948e-08, global = -4.25067e-19, cumulative = -1.89512e-18
 ExecutionTime = 0.54 s  ClockTime = 0 s

This makes sense: we decreased the cell size, so to keep the Courant number reasonable we also need to change the time step.
This is done by changing the value of the *deltaT* keyword in the *controlDict*.
We can set the time-step to 0.0005.

.. code:: bash

 deltaT 0.0005;

Running in parallel
+++++++++++++++++++

Let us now run the case in parallel.
Inspecting *system/decomposeParDict*, we see that the case is set to be decomposed into 4 subdomains.

.. code:: bash

 numberOfSubdomains  4;

We will leave this as is and now we can decompose the case and run in parallel.

.. code:: bash

 $ decomposePar

This will create directories *processor0* to *processor3*, containing the subdomains.
To run the case, execute the following command.

.. code:: bash

 $ mpirun -np 4 icoFoam -parallel > logfile.icoFoamParallel

Upon completion we can reconstruct the solution on the whole domain:

.. code:: bash
  
 $ reconstructPar -latestTime

Here, the *-latestTime* flag tells the program to only reconstruct the last time-step.

To do yourself:

- Now that we decreased the time step there is a lot of output saved, look at e.g. *processor0*.
  Change the *writeInterval* in the *controlDict* to reduce that.

- Play around with mesh sizes and change *decomposeParDict* to run on a larger number of processors.

- Go through https://www.pdc.kth.se/support/documents/run_jobs/job_scheduling.html#how-to-submit-jobs to learn how to
  submit jobs to the cluster queue. Try to submit your cavity case as a short queued job.
  A simple jobs script example is available in the `slides by Arash <https://github.com/ENCCS/OpenFOAM/blob/main/getting_started_with_Tegner.pdf>`_.


Increasing the Reynolds number
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

We will now increase the Reynolds number to *100*, at which point the solution takes a noticeably longer time to converge.

.. code:: bash

 $ cp -r cavity cavityHighRe

and then edit *transportProperties* dictionary to reduce the kinematic viscosity to *0.001*

.. code:: bash

 nu              0.01;

to 

.. code:: bash

 nu              0.001;


Increase the *endTime* from *0.5* to *2* so that *icoFoam*  run upto 2 seconds.

.. code:: bash 

 $ icoFoam

Turbulence modelling (optional)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The need to increase spatial and temporal resolution then becomes impractical as the flow moves into the turbulent regime, where problems of solution stability may also occur. 
Instead Reynolds-averaged simulation (RAS) turbulence models are used to solve for the mean 
flow behaviour and calculate the statistics of the fluctuations.
The standard k-epsilon model with wall functions will be used in this tutorial to solve the lid-driven cavity case with a Reynolds number of 10^4.
Two extra variables are solved for: k, the turbulent kinetic energy, and epsilon, the turbulent dissipation rate.
The additional equations and models for turbulent flow are implemented into a OpenFOAM solver called *pisoFoam*.
To setup the model you will need three additional files in the 0 directory: *nut*, *k*, *epsilon*.
Create them by making a copy of the *p* file, and then modify them as needed.

A range of wall function models is available in OpenFOAM that are applied as boundary conditions on individual patches.
This enables different wall function models to be applied to different wall regions.
The choice of wall function models are specified through the turbulent viscosity field, nut, in the *0/nut* file:

.. code:: bash

 dimensions      [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0];

 internalField   uniform 0;

 boundaryField
 {
    movingWall
    {
        type            nutkWallFunction;
        value           uniform 0;
    }
    fixedWalls
    {
        type            nutkWallFunction;
        value           uniform 0;
    }
    frontAndBack
    {
        type            empty;
    }
 }


You should should now open the field files for *k* and *epsilon* ( in *0/k* and *0/epsilon*) and set their boundary conditions. 
For a wall boundary condition wall, *epsilon* is assigned an *epsilonWallFunction* boundary condition and a *kqRwallFunction* boundary condition is assigned to *k*.
The latter is a generic boundary condition that can be applied to any field that are of a turbulent kinetic energy type, e.g. *k*, *q* or  Reynolds Stress *R* 


Turbulence modelling includes a range of methods, e.g. *RAS* or large-eddy simulation (*LES*), that are provided in OpenFOAM. In most transient solvers, the choice of turbulence modelling method is selectable at run-time through the simulationType keyword in turbulenceProperties dictionary. The user can view this file in the constant directory:

.. code:: bash 

 simulationType  RAS;

 RAS
 {
    RASModel        kEpsilon;

    turbulence      on;

    printCoeffs     on;
 }

The options for *simulationType* are *laminar*, *RAS* and *LES*. 
More informaton on turbulence models can be found in the Extended Code Guide 
With RAS selected in this case, the choice of *RAS* modelling is specified in 
a turbulenceProperties subdictionary, also in the constant directory. 
The turbulence model is selected by the *RASModel* entry from a long list of 
available models that are listed in User Guide Table. The k-Epsilon model 
should be selected which is is the standard k-epsilon 
the user should also ensure that turbulence calculation is switched on.

Finally, you can run the case with commands:

.. code:: bash

 $ blockMesh
 $ pisoFoam

Post-processing (optional)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The post-processing tool supplied with OpenFOAM is *paraFoam*, which is a wrapper of *paraview* (www.paraview.org).
The *paraFoam* post-processing is started by typing in the terminal from within the case directory with loading *paraview* module.

.. code:: bash

 $ module add paraview/5.8.1-gcc-7.2
 $ paraFoam
 
Alternatively, if you can add an empty file inside the case directory. 

.. code:: bash

 $ touch case.foam

You can now open this file with regular Paraview, and not *paraFoam*.

MotorBike
---------

This case uses OpenFOAM to calculate the steady flow around a motorbike and rider using RAS turbulence modelling with wall functions.
The initialization of flow velocity is to 20 m/s.
The box includes the bike and ride are approximately 2.0x0.8x1.3m and the estimated characteristic length scale L=0.5m, see the Figure below.

.. image:: img/motorbike_overall.png

As you will see, this is a more advanced case than the cavity, involving *snappyHexMesh* to generate the mesh, RANS modelling,
and using several function objects.
The idea is to further strengthen the familiarity with OpenFOAM input and have a more fun case to play around with than the cavity.


Notice that OpenFOAM cases are not backward compatible, please always copy cases from *$FOAM_TUTORIALS* of current version

.. code:: bash

 $ module add openfoam/1912
 $ echo $FOAM_BASHRC
 /pdc/vol/openfoam/v1912/OpenFOAM-v1912/etc/bashrc
 $ source $FOAM_BASHRC
 $ cp -r $FOAM_TUTORIALS/incompressible/simpleFoam/motorBike .

- The structure of the case is shown in the following

.. code:: bash

 $ cd motorBike
 $ ls

- The default setting is to run the application simpleFoam on 6 MPI-rank with background mesh block
  of size (20×8×8). The results are stored in 5 time steps 100, 200, 300, 400 and 500.


The following tasks are suggested during the hands-on session.

- Try to change some parameters in the snappyHexMeshDict, can you see what happens?

- Try to figure out what each fucntion object does. Search for documentation in the user guide.
  If you are brave, look at the source code, that is the big plus of open-source! 

- Think about what you typically look at in your CFD simulations. See if you can find a suitable function object.
  (Suggestions: inlet-outlet mass flow balance, y+ values, Co-number, velocity min/max, residuals, etc.)


Run the case by default
+++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code:: bash

 $ source $FOAM_BASHRC
 $ ./Allrun # run the workflow

The script *Allrun* is a script to collect all commands for whole workflow.
You can use it, but it is not very pedagogical. Better to manually go through each command to remember what it does.

.. code:: bash

 # Copy motorbike surface from resources directory
 cp $FOAM_TUTORIALS/resources/geometry/motorBike.obj.gz constant/triSurface/

 # Restore the 0 directory
 cp -r 0.orig 0
   
 # Extracts and writes surface features to file
 surfaceFeatureExtract

 # Create a block mesh, which will be the background mesh for snappy
 blockMesh

 # Decompose a mesh for parallelization
 decomposePar -copyZero

 # Run the snappyHexMesh in parallel!
 mpirun -np 6 snappyHexMesh -parallel -overwrite > log.snappyHexMesh

 # Run a potential flow solver
 mpirun -np 6 potentialFoam -parallel -writephi > log.potentialFoam

 # Run the steady-state solver for incompressible flow
 mpirun -np 6 simpleFoam -parallel > log.simpleFoam

 # Reconstruct the mesh using geometric information
 reconstructParMesh -constant

 # Reconstruct fields of the parallel case
 reconstructPar -latestTime

Some stuff worth noting here:

- We want to generate the mesh in parallel and this introduces some extra shenanigans into the workflow.
  This is not really needed for this case, but can be good to know.

- We generate the background mesh with *blockMesh* and then decompose that into subdomains with *decomposePar*.
  Here, we have to provide the *-copyZero* flag, so that the *0* folder is simply copied to the *processor* directories
  without change. Otherwise, some stuff will be "optimized away", for example entries for boundaries that are not found in the mesh.
  Since the background mesh generate by *blockMesh* does not contain the motorbike, this would completely ruin the *0* folder.

- We run *potentialFoam* to solve potential flow equations to get a better initial condition. Note a corresponding entry in *system/fvSolution*.
  
- After running the case we need to reconstruct not only the data but also the mesh, which was generated in parallel. For that, we use *reconstructParMesh*.
  The *-constant* flag makes it put the mesh directly into *constant/polyMesh*.


Validating the model
++++++++++++++++++++

To make sure everything is OK we can the output logs from the OpenFOAM run,
this will show if the run actually worked or not. For each stage there is a log.[stage]
output. For example, in the *log.simpleFoam* file the coefficients should be likes

.. code:: bash

 $ tail -n 50 ./log.simpleFoam
 ...
 Time = 500
 ...
 ExecutionTime = 279.99 s ClockTime = 281 s
 ...
 Coefficients
 Cm : 0.157483 (pressure: 0.149969 viscous: 0.00751474)
 Cd : 0.410867 (pressure: 0.393321 viscous: 0.0175461)
 Cl : 0.0751623 (pressure: 0.0758905 viscous: -0.000728213)
 Cl(f) : 0.195065
 Cl(r) : -0.119902
 ensightWrite ensightWrite write: ( U p k omega )
 End
 Finalising parallel run

Here you can see that function objects add new stuff to the log!

Parallelization
+++++++++++++++

we can change the MPI rank and the decomposition method in file *system/decomposeParDict*, for example, change the default

.. code:: bash

 numberOfSubdomains 6;
 method hierarchical;

to

.. code:: bash

 numberOfSubdomains 24; // MPI-rank
 method scotch;         // using scotch for partition

(Note: If you still used *method hierarchical*, the *hierarchicalCoeffs* in the file
should be coordinately changed)

.. code:: bash

 hierarchicalCoeffs
 {
 n (4 3 2); // 4x3x2 = 24 !!
 } 

The script *Allclean* can be used to delete the log files and remove the results from
motorBike run and then rerun again.

Mesh refinement
+++++++++++++++

- For scalability tests, the default mesh of 350 k cells may be small, (you can check the mesh information in *log.snappyHexMesh*

.. code:: bash

 Layer mesh : cells:353548  faces:1107696  points:405989

We need to increase the block mesh size and change the settings in file *system/blockMeshDict*, for example, from

.. code:: bash

 blocks
 (
 hex (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) (20 8 8) simpleGrading (1 1 1)
 );

to

.. code:: bash

 blocks
 (
 hex (0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7) (40 16 16) simpleGrading (1 1 1)
 );

i.e. the mesh size in x, y, and z-directory increases twice. The script *Allclean* can be used to delete the log files and remove the results from motorBike run and then rerun again.

(Notice: Please do not refine the mesh too much. Otherwise execution time becomes very long)

.. code :: bash

 $ ./Allclean
 $ ./Allrun

The total number of cells is around 1.8 M (check it the log.snappyHexMesh) 

.. code:: bash

 Layer mesh : cells:1892612  faces:5875533  points:2112502

snappyHexMesh
+++++++++++++

The mesher performs three steps to create the mesh from the background mesh and the stl surface of the motorbike.

.. code:: bash

 $ less system/snappyHexMeshDict

 // Which of the steps to run
 castellatedMesh true;
 snap            true;
 addLayers       true;

Try running snappyHexMesh without the *-overwrite* flag and take a look at the three produced meshes in the consecutive
time directories written.
Can you see the difference from step to step?
Note that *addLayers* can be removed, and the produced mesh will still conform to the geometry.

There are many settings which can be modified to refine and improve the mesh quality. For example,

.. code:: bash

 $ less system/snappyHexMeshDict
 ...

 // Geometry refinement for wak region 
 geometry
 {
    refinementBox
    {
        type box;
        min  (-1.0 -0.7 0.0);
        max  ( 8.0  0.7 2.5);
    }
 }
 
 ...

   // Region refinement used in Castellated mesh generation.
   refinementRegions
    {
        refinementBox
        {
            mode inside;
            levels ((1E15 4));
        }
    }

  ...

refines the mesh in a predifined box. Try changing the parameters of the box and look at the effect.
You could also try creating a new geometric primitve and refining it. As usual, to see what is there set *type* to *banana*,
let the mesher crash and write out available valid options.

Function objects
++++++++++++++++

The motorbike case contains several function objects distributed among respective files in *system*.
Take a look at them, try to understand what they do. Consult the User guide on openfoam.com.

.. code:: bash

 ...
 $ less system/controlDict

 functions
 {
    #include "streamLines"
    #include "wallBoundedStreamLines"
    #include "cuttingPlane"
    #include "forceCoeffs"
    #include "ensightWrite"
 }

 $ ls system
 blockMeshDict     decomposeParDict.6  fvSolution         surfaceFeatureExtractDict
 controlDict       ensightWrite        meshQualityDict    wallBoundedStreamLines
 cuttingPlane      forceCoeffs         snappyHexMeshDict
 decomposeParDict  fvSchemes           streamLines

Inspect the output form each of the objects. Open the streamlines in Paraview.
The Ensight output can also be opened in paraview directly, as well as the cut-plane.
For the forces, check out the .dat file in *postProcessing*.

Now, think of what else would be good to add to the simulation.
For example, writing down the residuals to a file.
Can you find a corresponding function object in the User guide?
Try to add it to the case!


Numerical schemes and solvers
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The numerical schemes are setting in the *system/fvSchemes*.
 
.. code:: bash

 ...
 ddtSchemes  // for time derivatives term

 gradSchemes // for divergence/convection term 

 divSchemes  // for gradient term

 laplacianSchemes // for Laplacian term
  ...

The solvers are selected in the *system/fvSolution*

.. code:: bash

 ...
     p  // GAMG is recommended for pressure
    {
        solver          GAMG;
        smoother        GaussSeidel;
    ...
    U  // for velocities
    {
        solver          smoothSolver;
        smoother        GaussSeidel;
 ...

More details about the OpenFOAM schemes and solvers can be found at `OpenFOAM: User Guide <https://www.openfoam.com/documentation/guides/latest/doc/index.html>`_
Feel free to horse around with the settings even if it kills the solver.
Use the banana trick to see what solvers are available e.g. for pressure and try to change to a different solver?
Is the case running faster or slower? You can always look at the execution time in the log file.


Post-processing
+++++++++++++++

As already mentioned multiple times, Paraview can be used to inspect the case: mesh, flow variable, function object output.
The motorbike case is great for a fancy visualization, so if you have the time and desire, try to produce something interesting!
It is easiest to work with Paraview on your own machine, but you can also use Tegner.

.. code:: bash

  $ module add paraview
  $ paraFoam
